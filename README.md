# Interview for Junior Full-Stack developer

Dear applicant,

thank you again for applying for the Junior Full-Stack developer position at Erento. With the following task we would like to verify your coding skills. Expected timeline for this assignment is to be finished within a week.

Below you can find 2 folders. Both are just simple initial applications generated from respective CLI tools. The [`interview-frontend`](./interview-frontend) is an Angular 16 frontend application and the [`interview-backend`](./interview-backend) is a NestJS 10 backend application.

As you can already spot, both are javascript applications, which is by far the most used language at Erento.

## What should you do?

1. On the frontend replace the existing content with a form where you can search for a city and list the results in some list formatted below.
2. On the backend prepare an endpoint to return the list of the cities which is matching the entry submitted from the frontend. Ideally, you will return up to 5 entries per page.

    In the root of this repository there is [cities.json](./cities.json) file - this should mock your database.

## Tips

- You should make sure your code is functional.
- You should also handle possible edge cases.
- You should be happy with your solution.
- Do you know how to test? This could be your chance to learn!
- Any progress would be good to track over git commits.

## Are you done?

You can give us the accomplished assignment in 2 ways of your choice:
1. Create a fork of our repository and send us a link to your Github repository when you are finished, or
2. Remove `node_modules` folder in both applications pack it into an archive and send it over an email.
